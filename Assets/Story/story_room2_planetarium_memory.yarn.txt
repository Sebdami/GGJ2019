The first time I went on a school trip during primary school, my parents told me there was no reason to be sad because despite the fact we were away from each other, we could still be looking at the same stars each night.
But when I looked up and saw Cepheus constellation, this shiny little house just reminded of how far I was from home.
I raised my hand to reach it, hoping it would suddenly bring me back home, but grasped nothing but the wind.
