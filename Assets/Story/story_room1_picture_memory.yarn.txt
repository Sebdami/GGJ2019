The studio is just as I left it.
I donâ€™t even remember the reason why I torned up this picture.
I can't manage to describe how I feel. This room has been my refugee for so long.
Photography was a way for me to connect with people without getting too close. Keeping the camera between us.
Here in the lab, I was able to fully express myself. I think I just love the process of giving birth to the shots I took. 
I should get back to it.
