The studio is just as I left it.
It saddens me that I torned up this picture. That was quite childish of me.
...
I can't manage to describe how I feel. This room has been my refugee for so long.
Photography was a way for me to connect with people without getting too close. Keeping the camera between us.
I think I also liked to work alone and to be able to make my own choices.
I should get back to it.
