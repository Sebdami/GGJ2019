Now I remember the name of this huge flower that gets through the ceiling.
Lily Stargazer.
Does she likes to contemplate Cepheus too? I like to think so.
This little fellow right here might end just as big as its sister in a few years.
I just hope someone will take care of it. Living in the shadow of the great Stargazer can be tough.
As a kid, I would come here to keep company to the smaller plants on the shelves so they feel just as loved and beautiful.
Because to me, they are.
