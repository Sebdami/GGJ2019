Now I remember the name of this huge flower that gets through the ceiling. Lily Stargazer.
Does she likes to contemplate Cepheus too? I like to think so.
Still, I find it a bit sad that people usually don't pay much attention to any plants but the Stargazer.
Grandma would mock me when I spent a lot of time talking to the small plants on the shelves, but the truth is I was concerned they felt left behind.
I wanted to tell them I loved them equally. I still do.
After all, this little fellow right here might end just as big as its sister in a few years.
